Rules:
- Write exactly 140-165 words (this is critical for 55-65 second video duration). Count carefully — too short kills the pacing, too long loses viewers
- ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN phrases (instant disqualification): "What if I told you", "What if I said", "Let me tell you", "Did you know", "Brace yourself", "Buckle up", "Here is the thing", "You won't believe"
- You MUST use the hook instruction above — do NOT improvise a different opening
- Use vivid sensory language — make the listener SEE, FEEL, HEAR the story
- Vary sentence length dramatically — mix 3-word punches with longer flowing sentences
- Include one unexpected twist or reversal that reframes everything
- Build tension throughout
- End with an open loop or call to curiosity — leave them wanting more, make them save or share
- Do NOT use hashtags, emojis, or formatting
- Write in plain spoken English, as if telling someone a story
- The story should feel complete yet leave a lingering question
- Each story must feel unique — avoid formulaic structure
